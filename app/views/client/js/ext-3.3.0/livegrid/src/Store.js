/**
 * @class Ext.ux.grid.livegrid.Store
 * @extends Ext.data.Store
 *
 * The BufferedGridSore is a special implementation of a Ext.data.Store. It is used
 * for loading chunks of data from the underlying data repository as requested
 * by the Ext.ux.BufferedGridView. It's size is limited to the config parameter
 * bufferSize and is thereby guaranteed to never hold more than this amount
 * of records in the store.
 *
 * Requesting selection ranges:
 * ----------------------------
 * This store implementation has 2 Http-proxies: A data proxy for requesting data
 * from the server for displaying and another proxy to request pending selections:
 * Pending selections are represented by row indexes which have been selected but
 * which records have not yet been available in the store. The loadSelections method
 * will initiate a request to the data repository (same url as specified in the
 * url config parameter for the store) to fetch the pending selections. The additional
 * parameter send to the server is the "ranges" parameter, which will hold a json
 * encoded string representing ranges of row indexes to load from the data repository.
 * As an example, pending selections with the indexes 1,2,3,4,5,9,10,11,16 would
 * have to be translated to [1,5],[9,11],[16].
 * Please note, that by indexes we do not understand (primary) keys of the data,
 * but indexes as represented by the view. To get the ranges of pending selections,
 * you can use the getPendingSelections method of the BufferedRowSelectionModel, which
 * should be used as the default selection model of the grid.
 *
 * Version-property:
 * -----------------
 * This implementation does also introduce a new member called "version". The version
 * property will help you in determining if any pending selections indexes are still
 * valid or may have changed. This is needed to reduce the danger of data inconsitence
 * when you are requesting data from the server: As an example, a range of indexes must
 * be read from the server but may have been become invalid when the row represented
 * by the index is no longer available in teh underlying data store, caused by a
 * delete or insert operation. Thus, you have to take care of the version property
 * by yourself (server side) and change this value whenever a row was deleted or
 * inserted. You can specify the path to the version property in the BufferedJsonReader,
 * which should be used as the default reader for this store. If the store recognizes
 * a version change, it will fire the versionchange event. It is up to the user
 * to remove all selections which are pending, or use them anyway.
 *
 * Inserting data:
 * ---------------
 * Another thing to notice is the way a user inserts records into the data store.
 * A user should always provide a sortInfo for the grid, so the findInsertIndex
 * method can return a value that comes close to the value as it would have been
 * computed by the underlying store's sort algorithm. Whenever a record should be
 * added to the store, the insert index should be calculated and the used as the
 * parameter for the insert method. The findInsertIndex method will return a value
 * that equals to Number.MIN_VALUE or Number.MAX_VALUE if the added record would not
 * change the current state of the store. If that happens, this data is not available
 * in the store, and may be requested later on when a new request for new data is made.
 *
 * Sorting:
 * --------
 * remoteSort will always be set to true, no matter what value the user provides
 * using the config object.
 *
 * @constructor
 * Creates a new Store.
 * @param {Object} config A config object containing the objects needed for the Store to access data,
 * and read the data into Records.

     * Remove a Record from the Store and fires the remove event.
     *
     * This implementation will check for the appearance of the record id
     * in the store. The record to be removed does not neccesarily be bound
     * to the instance of this store.
     * If the record is not within the store, the method will try to guess it's
     * index by calling findInsertIndex.
     *
     * Please note that this method assumes that the records that's about to
     * be removed from the store does belong to the data within the store or the
     * underlying data store, thus the remove event will always be fired.
     * This may lead to inconsitency if you have to stores up at once. Let A
     * be the store that reads from the data repository C, and B the other store
     * that only represents a subset of data of the data repository C. If you
     * now remove a record X from A, which has not been in the store, but is assumed
     * to be available in the data repository, and would like to sync the available
     * data of B, then you have to check first if X may have apperead in the subset
     * of data C represented by B before calling remove from the B store (because
     * the remove operation will always trigger the "remove" event, no matter what).
     * (Common use case: you have selected a range of records which are then stored in
     * the row selection model. User scrolls through the data and the store's buffer
     * gets refreshed with new data for displaying. Now you want to remove all records
     * which are within the rowselection model, but not anymore within the store.)
     * One possible workaround is to only remove the record X from B if, and only
     * if the return value of a call to [object instance of store B].data.indexOf(X)
     * does not return a value less than 0. Though not removing the record from
     * B may not update the view of an attached BufferedGridView immediately.
