20-March-2010
 - fixed: (Store.js) fixed an issue where the "selectionsProxy" would call a
method that was marked deprecated since Ext 3.0
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) splitted "liveScrolleInset" into 3 divs which
fixes issues when a large number of data should be shown in the grid; this
prevents incapabilities of browsers which define max heights for HTML Elements

04-January-2010
 - fixed: (GridView.js) fixed an issue where the grid would not be properly rendered
in IE due to deprecated "scrollOffset" property
 - enhancement: (JsonReader.js) added compatibility for Ext 3.0.3
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) replaced call to "Ext.each" in "processRows()"
with for-loop
 - fixed: (GridView.js) added property "loadMaskDisplayed" to indicate whether
loadMask is currently being displayed; fixed an issue that would not stripe rows
when grid is being refreshed;

10-July 2009
 - fixed: fixed an error that would be triggered if the store uses a custom proxy,
such as Ext.data.DirectProxy; introduced event "abortrequest" to be aware of cases
when custom proxies should abort any ongoing "read" server request

09-July 2009
 - fixed: (EditorGridPanel.js, GridPanel.js) call in "initComponent()" would not allow
an user to set the property "cls"as it would get override; checked for existence of
this property and concatenated it with default
 - enhancement: added Ext 3.0.0 compatibility
 - fixed: (GridView.js) listener "onBeforeLoad()" now aborts any ongoing server
request and properly resets properties "isBuffering" and "isPreBuffering"

26-June 2009
 - fixed: fixed an erroneous call to superclass' implementation of "initComponent()"
in Ext.ux.grid.livegrid.EditorGridPanel

20-June 2009
 - fixed: fixed a bug where "suspendLoadEvent" would not be reset, thus suspending all
load-events for further calls once it was set
(see http://www.extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=345273#post345273)
 - enhancement: added "examples"
 - enhancement: enhanced css rules
 - fixed: fixed a flaw which would remove focus from the scrollbar in IE7 by caching
the loadMask, which also speeds up rendering
 - enhancement: performance improvements in "GridView.liveBufferUpdate()" by only
re-rendering the view if there is no index left in the request-queue

08-June 2009
 - enhancement: (Store.js) updated api to work with Ext3.0RC2 (breaks backwards
compatibility with versions prior to Ext3.0Rc2)
 - enhancement: (Toolbar.js) minor code changes to make toolbar work with Ext3.0RC2
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) removed "loadMaskConfig" property and instead delegated loadmask
configuration to loadMask cfg property; simplified "showLoadMask" method

Version 0.3RC2 (GPL)
07-December-2008

 - fixed: (GridView.js) "renderUI()" would not set "this.dragZone" properly if
drag & drop is enabled for the GridView's grid
- fixed: (make.bat, make.sh) naming issues for debug-build resolved; enhanced
check if argument was submitted


Version 0.3RC1 (GPL)
23-November-2008

 - enhancement: added build tools for creating minified deployable versions of
Ext.ux.Livegrid-scripts
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) the rowIndex argument of the column's renderer will
now pass the value of the index of the row as available in the view, i.e. as defined
in the row's rowIndex property, which adds support for Ext.grid.RowNumberer
 - fixed: (GridView.js) fixed a bug where "getPredictedBufferIndex()" would not
compute the next rowIndex for a request properly, leading to an endless loop
 - enhancement: (GridView.js, RowSelectionModel.js) removed override of "onRefresh()"
to keep selections after a refresh or sort occured, if, and only if those records are
returned by the response; removed custom call to selection model's "clearSelections()"
in the GridView's "reset()" method
 - enhancement: intercepted "autoLoad" property of Ext.ux.grid.livegrid.Store to make
sure the store gets only loaded if the view has been rendered, if the store's autoLoad
property was set to "true"


Version 0.3a4 (GPL)
1-November-2008

 - fixed: (EditorGridPanel.js) call to "startEditing()" would throw error if the
requested index in the view is not currently representing a record; overrode
method for checking if record to edit is available
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) adjusted behavior of "ensureVisible()" to scroll a
requested cell horizontally into view

Version 0.3a3 (GPL)
1-November-2008

 - fixed: (Toolbar.js) when passing the grid as config parameter, the immediate
call to "bind" would throw an error since the views's "ds" property is not available
yet


Version 0.3a2 (GPL)
1-November-2008

 - enhancement: (Toolbar.js) config object allows now to specify either the grid
or the view the toolbar is bound to
 - fixed: (Store.js) "getAt()" would return "-1" if the data at the passed index
could not be found in some cases; changed to return type "undefined"
 - fixed: (GridView.js) overrode method "getCell()" to return "null" if the row
for the specified index could not be found
 - fixed: firing of event "cursormove" would happen before "replaceLiveRows()"
has taken care of re-assigning the rowIndex to the rows in the view which could
lead to errors; adjusted method and made sure that "replaceLiveRows()" is called
first
 - enhancement: (EditorGridPanel.js, GridPanel.js) added basic support for using
cell editors for the Livegrid (EditorGridPanel-support)
 - enhancement: (ext-ux-livegrid.css, DragZone.js) minor code cleanups, changed
css class "x-dd-drop-waiting" to "ext-ux-livegrid-drop-waiting"
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) added method "getRow()", removed overriden method
"onCellSelect()", "onCellDeselect()", "onRowOver()", "onRowOut()" and changed
arguments for call of methods that operate on Html-elements in the view to pass
the model index as specified in the elements "rowIndex"-property, which will get
translated internally to the html-element's index in the view, for broadening
compatibility to other plugins/exension, such as the EditorGridPanel
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) changed behavior of "processRows()" to paint the selections
if the third argument does not equal to "false"
 - enhancement: (RowSelectionModel.js) added method "deselectRecord()" to deselect a record
that is already selected in the model
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) added method "isRecordRendered()" to check whether the passed
record is currently within the visible rect of the grid's view
 - enhancement: removed programmatically invoking scroll in IE when the grid is rendered,
since this was fixed due to the css changes in a previously version
 - fixed: (RowSelectionModel.js) method "isSelected()" would lose it's original argument
while processing it, which could lead to erroneous behavior
 - fixed: (GridView.js) missing call to "isBuffering = true" in "updateLiveRows()"
made the component to ignore a previously set queue and request new data immediately

Version 0.3a1 (GPL)
29-September-2008

 - enhancement: added Ext 2.2 compatibility, refactored code, changed ui to match
Ext style
 - License changed from LGPL to GPL
 - enhancement: changed namespace to "Ext.ux.grid.livegrid":
  +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  |        old name                       |          new name                      |

  +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
 - fixed: rows would not be striped properly when grid panel's "stripeRows" property
is set to true
 - fixed: rendering bug of the vertical scrollbar in IE7 did not trigger the scroll
event to small; set min height to two times of horizontalScrollOffset property
 - fixed: vertical scrollbar would disappear in FF3 if the size of the viewport gets
to small; set min height to two times of horizontalScrollOffset property
 - fixed: view would not always calculate the grid's size leading to errors when it
should decide whether the horizontal scrollbar is shown
 - enhancement: added "bulkRemove()" method and "bulkremove" event to store, added
"bulkremove"-listener to BufferedGridView
 - fixed: (RowSelectionModel.js) added a property for mapping already
selected records to their view index, so that the position of records, which are
no longer in the store, can still be referenced. Added support for removing and
shifting selections if a record was removed that is not part of the store, but
still could be referenced using the map
 - fixed: (Store.js) when removing records which are not buffered by the
store, and which are behind the range of the currently buffered record set, the
"remove" method now adjusts the values of the "bufferRange"-property minus the
number of records removed, to reflect the changes in the underlying data model
 - fixed: (GridView.js) when removing rows which are not part of the data
model, the "rowIndex" and "lastRowIndex" properties are now both updated, and the
remaining rows in the view processed by "processRows()"
 - fixed: (GridView.js) "forceRepaint" argument for the "updateLiveRows"
method is now passed using the "options"-object of the Ajax.request, which will
then be passed to the "replaceLiveRows()".method called by the "liveBufferUpdate()".
 - fixed: (GridView.js) last revision had a typo left that caused the rows
not to be updated when the "insertRows()" method would be called with the
"isUpdate"-argument set to true
 - enhancement: (GridView.js) changed "onRemove()" method to not support
"isUpdate" argument, since the current implementation of GridView would
never call "onRemove" for simply updating a row in the view
 - fixed: bufferRange will now get reset if all records in the store are removed

Version 0.2
11-September-2008

Version 0.2rc5
31-August-2008

- fixed:
 - BufferedGridView.js: typo left in "insertRows()" would prevent the view to reassign
the proper rowIndex when argument "isUpdate" was set to true
 - BufferedGridView.js: wrong parameter passed to "buffer" and "beforebuffer" event caused
listeners to use wrong number of visible rows in the grid


Version 0.2rc4
30-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedStore.js: store would not allow for adding records without throwing errors when
the store was initialized with no records; changed bufferRange to be initialized with [0,0]
instead of [0, bufferSize] and incremented bufferRange-count according to the records coming
in, until bufferRange[1] equals to bufferSize
 - BufferedGridView.js, BufferedRowSelectionModel.js: store "add" event would neccessarily
trigger the selectionmodel's onAdd-listener before the onAdd-listener of the GridView, resulting
in false rendering of selected records; changed the selection model to listen to the "rowsinserted"
event of the view and extended this event to pass the length of added record as the fourth
parameter to all it's listeners
 - BufferedGridView.js: collapsed panel would hide added records of the grid when the grid is
expanded again and would lose scroll-position; added listener for "expand"-event of the view's
gridpanel to recalculate visible rows, the buffer inset and reset the scrollbar's position to the
proper value
 - BufferedGridView.js: "onAdd()" would not always insert records depending on the position they got
added in the store; updated and improved code based on "rows get added before first visible row",
"rows get added after the last visible row", "rows get added somewhere in between the first and last visible row"
- enhancements:
 - BufferedGridView.js: improved calculation of rows that would cause spill when new records
get added in "insertRows()"


Version 0.2rc3
30-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedGridView.js: last row would not always be rendered proper if the end of
records is reached and the panel would be resized so that more records are displayable
- enhancements:
 - BufferedGridView.js: improved calculating the height of the buffer inset in both
performance and functionality. Component now working with Safari 3.1 under Windows XP

Version 0.2rc2
29-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedGridView.js: re-rendering rows would not work proper if a resize of the panel
during buffering happened; "adjustVisibleRows()" skips recalculating the "rowIndex"
property now if the livegrid is currently buffering. "replaceLiveRows()" would not always
calculate the exact range of rows to render; adjusted conditions to check for valid ranges

Version 0.2rc1
29-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedGridView.js: fixed a bug that would not recalculate the scrollbar's
height if the number of possible rows to display in the view would exceed the
total number of records in the store
 - BufferedRowSelectionModel: "selectRow()" would allow selecting indexes greater than
the "totalLength"-property of the store; added condition to check whether the index is
out of bounds (closes google issue 5)
- BufferedStore.js: buffer range would not store the number of the total length
of the records when last possible range is reached, but instead the number of the
start-parameter with the "limit"-parameter, which lead to errors when a last
possible record to render is requested that cannot be found in the store

 - enhancements:
- BufferedGridView.js: last row in the grid is now clipped instead of removed if
it is not fully displayable



Version 0.1.2
25-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedGridView: wrong calculation of "start"-parameter for the buffer-request
caused infinite loop. Adjusted calculation of return value in "getPredictedBufferIndex()"
to always return correct value for "start"-parameter if the "nearLimit" property is greater
than or equals to half of store's "bufferSize" property (fixes google issue 4)

Version 0.1.1
25-August-2008

- fixes:
 - BufferedGridView: grid would not be repainted correctly if a column was moved:
method "onColumnMove()" with appropriate implementation added (fixes google issue 9);
"onRemove()" would not work properly if the end of the data was reached in the visible
rect and rows from within that rect are removed. Adjusted "lastRowIndex" to be equal to
"rowIndex", and skipped implicit "processRows()" call in "replaceLiveRows()" via passing
a new third argument "processRows", which will only call "processRows()" if the argument
was not set to false; removed call to "selections.add()" in "processRows()" since selections
are already in the "bufferedSelections" property of the selection model, and previously
selected records are still part of the "selections"-property of the selection model.


- enhancements:
 - BufferedGridView: Added functionality for listening to erroneous responses from
buffer-requests. Event "bufferfailure" will now be fired if the store indicated that
the proxy's response was erroneous; added "options" parameter to be passed to
"buffer"-event

 - BufferedGridToolbar: Toolbar is now listening to "bufferfailure"-event and resets
the reload-button to "enabled" if necessary.

Version 0.1
16-June-2008

- enhancements:
 - BufferedGridStore - added overrride of getAt() method to translate
the passed argument to the appropriate index in the model; updated sources to take
overriden method into account
 - added cfg option "scrollDelay" in BufferedGridView for buffering calls to onLiveScroll
when scroll-event gets fired (thanks to Rich Waters)
 - BufferedStore: removed custom applySort() implementation due to changes in findInsertIndex
 - BufferedStore: changed findInsertIndex to use parent implementation first, then check
return value and adjust the index if needed
 - BufferedStore/BufferedGridView: moved bufferRange-member to BufferedStore
 - BufferedStore: optimized insert() method in BufferedStore
 - allowed to add records at position "0" in grid (existing records get shifted down)

- fixes:
 - wrong calculation in BufferedGridView.onLiveScroll (based on lastScrollPosition and actual
scrollPosition) caused the view sometimes to not re-render some rows
 - provided bug fix for "ensureVisible: returned x-coordinate does not take the x-position
of the gridpanel into account" (see http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=175331#post175331)
 - wrong calculation of last displayable row after removing a row caused selection-model
to get out of synch with the store's data
 - when adding a record to the store on the fly, the ensureVisible-method
would not work always corect afterwards
 - when adding records, a previously made selection would block selecting the
newly added record
 - skipped request for updateLiveRows in Ext.ux.grid.BufferedGridView.adjustVisibleRows
when number of total records in store is less than the number of visible rows
 - request for buffering data in Ext.ux.grid.BufferedGridView.updateLiveRows() did
not apply the property "lastOptions.params" to the params sent with the buffer-request
